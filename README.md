# Around the Hello, World! - A CLI Basketball Game

## Introduction
Around the Hello, World! is a game that tests your knowledge on python. 

How to play:

There are TEN spots on the court:  Five TWO-POINT shots, and Five THREE-POINT shots.
You will start with the Five TWO-POINT shots first, and slowly work your way up to the three point line shots.

- Every time you get an easy question right (TWO-POINTER) on the first try, you get TWO points!
- Every time you get a hard question right (THREE-POINTER) on the first try, you get THREE points!

If you get the question wrong, you will stay in the same spot on the court, and you will be reasked the question. If you get that right,
you will advance, but you will get one less point for the spot.

You can only progress towards the end of the game every time you get the questions right.

Have fun, try to cash in points, and be as accurate as possible from the field!
